> **Note**: For detailed setup instructions, including troubleshooting, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KotOR.js.git
cd KotOR.js
```

1. Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/KobaltBlu/KotOR.js.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts for common development tasks:

#### Build Scripts

- `npm run build` - Full production build (webpack + Electron)
- `npm run build:dev` - Full development build (faster)
- `npm run build:web` - Production webpack bundle only
- `npm run build:web:dev` - Development webpack bundle (one-off)
- `npm run build:electron` - Compile Electron main process only
- `npm run pack` - Build and package Electron app (electron-builder)

#### Development Scripts

- `npm start` - Compile main process and start Electron application
- `npm run dev` - Watch main process and auto-restart Electron on changes
- `npm run watch` - Build web bundle in watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)

#### Testing Scripts

- `npm test` - Run all tests with coverage
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:quick` - Run tests without coverage (faster)

#### Documentation Scripts

- `npm run typedoc` - Generate API documentation

#### Code Quality Scripts

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Typical Development Session

1. **Start the development build** (in one terminal):

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will watch for file changes and automatically rebuild the web bundle.

1. **Start the Electron application** (in another terminal):

```bash
npm start
```

Or use dev mode for automatic restarts when the main process changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. **Make your changes** in the `src/` directory

2. **Test your changes** by running the application

3. **Run tests** before committing:

```bash
npm test
```

1. **Check code quality**:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking where possible
- Avoid `any` types; use proper types or `unknown`
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections
- Export types and interfaces that may be used elsewhere

### ESLint and type safety

The project uses strict TypeScript ESLint rules, including the `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` rules (e.g. `no-unsafe-assignment`, `no-unsafe-call`). These report uses of values whose type is `any` or could not be resolved ("unsafe" use).

For a beginner-friendly explanation of what "unsafe" means, why these rules exist, and how to fix or handle them, see **[docs/ESLINT_TYPE_SAFETY.md](docs/ESLINT_TYPE_SAFETY.md)**.

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Endings**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings, double quotes for JSX attributes
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons
- **Trailing Commas**: Use in multi-line arrays/objects
- **Max Line Length**: 120 characters (soft limit)

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for classes/components (e.g., `GameState.ts`), camelCase for utilities (e.g., `binaryReader.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `GameInitializer`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `initializeGame`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase, often prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IGameState`)
- **Enums**: PascalCase (e.g., `GameEngineType`)

### File Organization

- One class/interface per file
- Use `index.ts` files for barrel exports
- Group related files in directories
- Keep files focused and under 500 lines when possible

### Comments and Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs:

```typescript
/**
 * Initializes the game engine and loads necessary resources.
 *
 * @param gamePath - Path to the game installation directory
 * @param gameType - Type of game (KotOR I or II)
 * @returns Promise that resolves when initialization is complete
 * @throws {Error} If the game path is invalid
 */
async function initializeGame(gamePath: string, gameType: GameEngineType): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Import Organization

Organize imports in this order:

1. External dependencies (React, THREE.js, etc.)
2. Internal modules (from `src/`)
3. Relative imports
4. Type-only imports (use `import type`)

Example:

```typescript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import React from 'react';

import { GameState } from '../GameState';
import { Module } from './Module';

import type { GameEngineType } from '../enums/engine';
```

### Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Throw meaningful error messages
- Use custom error classes when appropriate
- Log errors appropriately (console.error for development)

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Cache expensive operations
- Lazy load resources when possible

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Place test files next to source files with `.spec.ts` or `.test.ts` extension
- Use descriptive test names: `describe('GameState', () => { it('should initialize with default values', () => { ... }) })`
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical paths

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage (default for npm test)
npm test
```

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { GameState } from './GameState';

describe('GameState', () => {
  let gameState: GameState;

  beforeEach(() => {
    gameState = new GameState();
  });

  it('should initialize with default values', () => {
    expect(gameState.isInitialized).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should throw error when accessing uninitialized state', () => {
    expect(() => gameState.getCurrentModule()).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Include parameter types, return types, and exceptions
- Add usage examples for complex functions
- Keep documentation in sync with code

### API Documentation

Generate API documentation:

```bash
npm run typedoc
```

This creates documentation in the `wiki/` directory.

### README Updates

- Update README.md when adding major features
- Keep installation instructions current
- Add examples for new functionality

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your fork**:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

1. **Create a feature branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Or for bug fixes:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

1. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

2. **Run tests**:

```bash
npm test
```

1. **Check code quality**:

```bash
npm run lint
```

1. **Commit your changes**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
