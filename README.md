# KotOR.js

**A remake of the Odyssey Game Engine that powered KotOR I &amp; II written in JavaScript**

This project is still in it's early stages. Things like displaying Ingame Menus, Models, Sound, and Scripting are all some what working.
There is still a long ways to go before it can play either game from beginning to end, which is a dream of mine :).

There is also very early attempt at a Modding Suite called KotOR Forge packaged inside.

The code is written in Javascript. It uses THREE.js for the rendering engine, Electron to package and run the code as an app.

If you plan on attempting to run either game you will first have to purchase and or install them. Once you attempt to launch either game from the KotOR.js launcher for the first time you will be ask to locate the install directory of said game.
